RCCL environment variables
********************************************************************

This section describes the most important RCCL environment variables,
which are grouped by functionality.

Configuration and setup
========================

The configuration and setup environment variables for RCCL are collected
in the following table.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 40,60

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Values**

    * - | ``NCCL_CONF_FILE``
        | Specifies the path to the RCCL configuration file.
      - | String path to configuration file
        | Default: ``~/.rccl.conf`` or ``/etc/rccl.conf``

    * - | ``NCCL_IBVERBS_LIB``
        | Specifies the libibverbs shared object that RCCL loads at runtime for
          the InfiniBand/RoCE (IB verbs) transport. Use it when rdma-core is
          installed in a non-default prefix, such as inside a container or an
          HPC software module, where the loader cannot find the library by its
          default name. When the override is unset or fails to load, RCCL falls
          back to ``libibverbs.so`` and then ``libibverbs.so.1``. ``NCCL_LIBIBVERBS_SO``
          is accepted as an alias and is used when ``NCCL_IBVERBS_LIB`` is unset.
      - | String path or soname of the libibverbs shared object
        | Default: unset (loads ``libibverbs.so`` or ``libibverbs.so.1``)

    * - | ``NCCL_HOSTID``
        | Sets the host identifier for multi-node communication.
      - | String value for host identification
        | Used for host hash generation

    * - | ``NCCL_BOOTSTRAP_BIDIR_ALLGATHER``
        | Enables the bidirectional ring AllGather (N/2 steps) on the socket OOB path
          during bootstrap. The unidirectional ring (N-1 steps) is kept as a fallback.
          Has no effect when net OOB is in use.
      - | ``0``: Force unidirectional ring.
        | ``1``: Force bidirectional ring (default).

    * - | ``NCCL_CUMEM_ENABLE``
        | Enables cuMem virtual memory management (VMM) for RCCL allocations,
          which is required for ``ncclCommSuspend`` and ``ncclCommResume`` to
          release the physical GPU memory of a suspended communicator. See
          :ref:`suspend-resume` for the full prerequisites.
      - | ``0``: Disabled.
        | ``1``: Enabled on any architecture.
        | ``-2``: Auto-detect (default); enable when the platform supports VMM.
          Auto-detect is limited to gfx1250, the only architecture where the VMM
          path is validated. Use ``1`` to force it on elsewhere.

    * - | ``NCCL_RMA_DISABLE``
        | Disables the RMA proxy, the network path for one-sided RMA. The proxy
          is never connected and windows are not registered with it.
      - | ``0``: RMA proxy enabled (default).
        | ``1``: RMA proxy disabled.

    * - | ``NCCL_MIN_CTAS``
        | Minimum number of CTAs (channels) used for a collective. Overrides
          the ``minCTAs`` field of ``ncclConfig_t``.
      - | Positive integer (values ``<= 0`` are ignored).
        | Default: unset (uses the RCCL default).

    * - | ``NCCL_MAX_CTAS``
        | Maximum number of CTAs (channels) used for a collective. Overrides
          the ``maxCTAs`` field of ``ncclConfig_t``.
      - | Positive integer (values ``<= 0`` are ignored).
        | Default: unset (uses the RCCL default).

    * - | ``NCCL_ENV_PLUGIN``
        | Loads an external environment plugin that intercepts all RCCL parameter
          lookups. See :ref:`using-rccl-env-plugin` for full details.
      - | Path to a plugin ``.so`` file, a bare name expanded to
          ``librccl-env-<name>.so``, or ``none`` to disable.
        | Default: unset (tries ``librccl-env.so``, then reads from the process
          environment).

    * - | ``NCCL_ENV_JSON_FILE``
        | Path to a JSON configuration file used by ``librccl-env-json.so``.
          Has no effect unless ``NCCL_ENV_PLUGIN`` points to that plugin.
      - | Path to a flat JSON file mapping variable names to string values.
          Relative paths are resolved from the application's working directory.
        | Default: unset (falls back to ``getenv()`` for all lookups).

    * - | ``NCCL_ALLGATHERV_ENABLE``
        | Fuses grouped multi-root ``ncclBroadcast`` calls into a single AllGatherV
          ring kernel when two or more distinct roots appear in a group.
      - | ``0``: Disabled (default).
        | ``1``: Enabled.

    * - | ``RCCL_HIERARCHICAL_LAZY_INIT``
        | Controls when a communicator of eight or more nodes builds the
          sub-communicators that hierarchical AllGather uses. Ignored when
          ``RCCL_HIERARCHICAL_REDUCE_SCATTER=1``. All ranks in a communicator
          must use the same value.
      - | ``0``: Build them during communicator initialization (default).
        | ``1``: Build them on the first AllGather eligible for hierarchical
          AllGather, outside graph capture.

Logging and debugging
=====================

The logging and debugging environment variables for RCCL are collected
in the following table.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 35,65

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Values**

    * - | ``NCCL_DEBUG``
        | Controls debug logging in RCCL for troubleshooting and monitoring collective communication operations. 
      - | These are the logging levels in RCCL set via ``NCCL_DEBUG``. Each logging level contains all logging for levels below it. The default logging level is ``ERROR``.
        |
        | ``NONE``: No logging is printed.
        | ``ERROR``: These messages report when a fatal condition has occurred in RCCL and the operation can't continue.
        | ``VERSION``: ``librccl`` version info is printed during the initialization phase.
        | ``WARN``: Prints warnings about unusual conditions that could lead to unexpected results.
        | ``ATTN``: Prints ``WARN`` messages plus notices that need attention, such as a plugin named in ``NCCL_*_PLUGIN`` that could not be loaded or initialized. ``INFO`` also prints these notices.
        | ``INFO``: Prints standard logging messages about status and operations performed.
        | ``ABORT``: Unused.
        | ``TRACE``: Prints trace-level logging of function calls and parameters. Only active when ``librccl`` is built using ``ENABLE_TRACE``.

    * - | ``NCCL_DEBUG_SUBSYS``
        | Controls which subsystems generate debug output.
      - | These are the logging subsystems set via ``NCCL_DEBUG_SUBSYS``. These can be set as a comma-separated list, and can be inverted using the ``^`` prefix. The default subsystem set is ``INIT``, ``BOOTSTRAP``, and ``ENV``.
        |
        | ``INIT``: Prints during the initialization phase.
        | ``COLL``: Prints during execution of collectives.
        | ``P2P``: Prints logs related to peer-to-peer setup or communication.
        | ``SHM``: Prints logs related to shared memory.
        | ``NET``: Prints logs related to network setup or communication.
        | ``GRAPH``: Prints logs related to parsing the topology of the network.
        | ``TUNING``: Prints logs related to the tuner plugin.
        | ``ENV``: Prints logs related to environment variables.
        | ``ALLOC``: Prints logs related to memory allocation.
        | ``CALL``: Prints logs for function calls (``TRACE`` only).
        | ``PROXY``: Prints logs related to the proxy thread.
        | ``NVLS``: Not valid for AMD/RCCL.
        | ``BOOTSTRAP``: Prints logs related to the bootstrapping phase of initialization.
        | ``REG``: Prints logs related to registration and deregistration of transport initialization.
        | ``PROFILE``: Prints logs related to the profiling/timing info.
        | ``RAS``: Prints logs related to RAS.
        | ``VERBS``: Prints logs related to IB/Verbs.
        | ``DESTROY``: Prints logs related to communicator/plugin teardown (destroy, abort, revoke, plugin unload).
        | ``ALL``: Activates all logging subsystems.

    * - | ``NCCL_WARN_ENABLE_DEBUG_INFO``
        | Converts all ``WARN`` level logs to ``INFO`` level logs.
      - | ``0``: Default value. Variable is not enabled.
        | ``1``: Enable the variable.

    * - | ``NCCL_DEBUG_TIMESTAMP_LEVELS``
        | The timestamp levels for ``NCCL_DEBUG``.
      - | A set of ``NCCL_DEBUG`` levels can have a timestamp prepended set as a comma-separated list which can be inverted using the ``^`` prefix. The default set is ``WARN`` and ``ATTN``.

    * - | ``NCCL_DEBUG_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT``
        | The timestamp format for ``NCCL_DEBUG``.
      - | Set the format of the timestamp in ``printf`` style. The default format is ``"[%F %T] "``.

    * - | ``NCCL_DEBUG_FILE``
        | Write logs to a file rather than ``stdout``.
      - | The filename can be formatted using ``%h`` for hostname, ``%p`` for pid, and ``%%`` to escape the ``%`` character. It is recommended to use ``%p`` to output to individual files per pid to avoid mixing or potentially overwriting the output. Example usage: ``NCCL_DEBUG_FILE=debugfile.%h.%p``

    * - | ``NCCL_CHECK_MODE``
        | Selects how thoroughly RCCL validates the arguments of every
          collective call. Checking costs latency, so it is disabled by default
          and intended for development and bring-up. See
          :ref:`check-mode` for what each mode detects.
      - | ``DEFAULT``: No argument validation (default).
        | ``DEBUG_LOCAL``: Validate the buffer pointers locally on each rank.
          Replaces the deprecated ``NCCL_CHECK_POINTERS``.
        | ``DEBUG_GLOBAL``: Also validate arguments across ranks, including
          symmetric buffer registration.
        | Values other than ``DEBUG_LOCAL`` and ``DEBUG_GLOBAL`` leave the mode
          unchanged, so writing ``DEFAULT`` does not switch checking off again.

    * - | ``NCCL_CHECK_POINTERS``
        | Deprecated. Enables local validation of the buffer pointers passed to
          each collective.
      - | ``0``: Disabled (default).
        | ``1``: Enabled, equivalent to ``NCCL_CHECK_MODE=DEBUG_LOCAL``.
        | Use ``NCCL_CHECK_MODE`` instead. When both are set, ``DEBUG_LOCAL`` or
          ``DEBUG_GLOBAL`` wins; any other ``NCCL_CHECK_MODE`` value keeps the
          mode selected by ``NCCL_CHECK_POINTERS=1``.

.. _check-mode:

Validating collective arguments
-------------------------------

``NCCL_CHECK_MODE=DEBUG_LOCAL`` inspects only what a rank can see by itself: it
verifies that the ``sendbuff`` and ``recvbuff`` arguments are valid device
pointers that belong to the device the communicator was created on. Passing a
host pointer or a pointer from another device makes the collective return
``ncclInvalidArgument`` instead of faulting inside the kernel.

``NCCL_CHECK_MODE=DEBUG_GLOBAL`` adds cross-rank validation of symmetric buffer
registration. The symmetric kernels require every rank to describe its buffers
identically, because a rank addresses a peer's buffer by applying its own offsets
to the peer's symmetric window. RCCL cannot verify that from a single rank, so at
group launch the ranks exchange the identity of the windows backing their buffers
and compare against rank 0. A collective is rejected with
``ncclInvalidArgument`` when:

* Some ranks pass buffers registered with ``NCCL_WIN_COLL_SYMMETRIC`` while
  others pass unregistered buffers.
* The ranks pass buffers from windows registered at different positions in the
  symmetric address space.
* The ranks pass buffers at different offsets inside their windows.

Each rejection is reported by rank 0 with a ``WARN`` message naming the
collective, the message size, and the first rank that disagrees, so set
``NCCL_DEBUG=WARN`` when using this mode. Setting ``NCCL_DEBUG=INFO`` with
``NCCL_DEBUG_SUBSYS=COLL`` additionally prints a ``SymCheck`` line per rank with
the window and user offsets that were compared.

Without this mode such a mismatch is not diagnosed: RCCL silently falls back to
the general kernels for calls it cannot serve symmetrically, so the collective
still produces correct results but loses the performance of the symmetric path.
Enable ``DEBUG_GLOBAL`` when a workload registers symmetric windows yet does not
reach the expected symmetric performance.

.. note::

   ``DEBUG_GLOBAL`` adds a bootstrap all-gather to every group launch, which is
   far more expensive than the collective itself for small messages. Use it to
   diagnose a configuration, not in production.

Algorithm and protocol control
==============================

The algorithm and protocol control environment variables for RCCL are
collected in the following table.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 40,60

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Values**

    * - | ``NCCL_ALGO``
        | Forces specific algorithm selection for collectives.
      - | Algorithm name string
        | Used to override automatic algorithm selection

    * - | ``NCCL_PROTO``
        | Forces specific protocol selection for communication.
      - | Protocol name string
        | Used to override automatic protocol selection

    * - | ``RCCL_DIRECT_ALLGATHER_DISABLE``
        | Controls the direct AllGather algorithm. Because the algorithm builds a full
          point-to-point mesh, its queue-pair footprint grows with the square
          of the job size.
      - | ``-1``: Automatic (default). Not selected on AINIC above 8 nodes.
        | ``0``: Skips the automatic AINIC check. The size, architecture and
          CTA-policy gates in ``rcclUseAllGatherDirect`` still apply.
        | Any other value: Disabled.

    * - | ``RCCL_HIERARCHICAL_ALLGATHER_MIN_BYTES_PER_RANK``
        | Sets the smallest AllGather, in bytes per rank (``sendcount`` x type
          size), that can select hierarchical AllGather, so that small startup
          AllGathers such as PyTorch DDP's 8-byte one stay on the default path.
          ``rccl-tests`` reports the total size, this value times the number of
          ranks. All ranks in a communicator must use the same value.
      - | Bytes per rank
        | Default: ``16``
        | ``0``: No lower bound.

    * - | ``RCCL_HIERARCHICAL_REDUCE_SCATTER_MIN_BYTES_PER_RANK``
        | Sets the smallest ReduceScatter, in bytes per rank (``recvcount`` x
          type size), that can select hierarchical ReduceScatter.
      - | Bytes per rank
        | Default: ``16``
        | ``0``: No lower bound.

Network and topology
====================

The network and topology environment variables for RCCL are collected
in the following table.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 40,60

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Values**

    * - | ``NCCL_IB_HCA``
        | Specifies InfiniBand device:port to use.
      - | Device specification string
        | Prefix with ``^`` for exclusion, ``=`` for exact match

    * - | ``NCCL_IB_GID_INDEX``
        | Defines the Global ID index used in RoCE mode.
      - | Integer value (default: ``-1``)
        | See InfiniBand ``show_gids`` command for valid values

    * - | ``NCCL_IB_QUERY_PORT_SPEED``
        | Controls whether RCCL queries the extended port speed
          (``ibv_query_port`` active speed extension) for bandwidth reporting.
          Disabling it falls back to the legacy ``active_speed``/
          ``active_width`` computation and disables runtime speed-change
          detection.
      - | ``1``: Query the extended speed (default).
        | ``0``: Use the legacy speed field only.

    * - | ``NCCL_IB_SUBNET_AWARE_ROUTING``
        | Enables subnet-aware device selection.
          When a peer's GID subnet does not match the default device's RoCE
          ports, RCCL searches other locally merged devices for one whose
          ports do match, so the connection uses a device on the same subnet
          as the peer. Only meaningfully exercised on a multi-subnet RoCE
          fabric (for example, behind an IB router); on a single-subnet
          cluster the default device already matches and this is a no-op.
      - | ``0``: Disabled (default).
        | ``1``: Enabled.

    * - | ``NCCL_IB_SUBNET_PREFIX_LEN``
        | Prefix length, in bits, used when comparing two GIDs' subnets for
          ``NCCL_IB_SUBNET_AWARE_ROUTING``.
      - | Integer value, bits (default: ``24``)

    * - | ``NCCL_PXN_C2C``
        | Allows PXN routing through a C2C link to reach a NIC attached to a
          peer GPU. The C2C path is NVIDIA-specific and is not currently
          applicable on AMD hardware.
      - | ``0``: Disabled (default).
        | ``1``: Enabled.

    * - | ``NCCL_GIN_MLOPART``
        | Allows GPU-initiated networking (GIN) on a communicator that contains
          a rank running on a GPU partition. An MI300X CPX partition is exposed
          as PCI function ``.1`` through ``.7`` of the physical device, and
          RCCL marks every such rank as partitioned; without this variable one
          partitioned rank turns GIN off for the whole communicator. Doing so
          can also clear symmetric memory support, which sends
          ``ncclCommWindowRegister`` down a non-symmetric path. A partition
          reaches xGMI and the network over the physical device's paths, so GIN
          is as available to a partition as it is to the whole GPU. This
          mirrors ``NCCL_NET_GDR_MLOPART``, which already lets a partition keep
          GDR. See :ref:`device-api-gin` and :ref:`nps4_cpx_mi300_rccl`.
      - | ``1``: Allow GIN on partitions (default).
        | ``0``: Disable GIN whenever any rank of the communicator runs on a
          partition, restoring the behavior from before this variable existed.
        | A communicator with no partitioned rank is unaffected by either value.

    * - | ``NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME``
        | Specifies which IP interfaces to use for communication.
        | When unset, RCCL auto-selects an interface in this order:
        | ``ib*`` first; if none is found and ``NCCL_COMM_ID`` is set, an
        | interface on the same subnet as that address; then any interface
        | other than ``docker*``, ``lo`` and ``virbr*``; then ``docker*``;
        | then ``lo``; and finally ``virbr*``. Libvirt bridge interfaces
        | (``virbr*``) are considered last because they serve host-to-VM
        | (virtual machine) traffic and cannot reach a remote node.
      - | Interface prefix string or list
        | Multiple prefixes separated by ``,``
        | Prefix with ``^`` for exclusion, ``=`` for exact match
        | Example: ``eth`` (all eth interfaces), ``=eth0`` (exact match)

    * - | ``NCCL_SOCKET_FAMILY``
        | Forces IPv4/IPv6 interface selection.
      - | ``AF_INET``: Force IPv4
        | ``AF_INET6``: Force IPv6
        | Unset: Use first available

    * - | ``NCCL_IGNORE_NET_MISMATCH``
        | Controls what happens when ranks report a different number of local
          network (NET) devices during communicator initialization. RCCL gathers
          each rank's local NET device count and compares the minimum and maximum
          across the communicator. A mismatch usually means the job was launched
          with an inconsistent NIC selection (for example, an uneven
          ``NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME``/``NCCL_IB_HCA`` per rank, or nodes with different
          NIC counts), which otherwise surfaces later as obscure transport
          failures. See :ref:`heterogeneous-nic-counts`.
      - | ``1``: Detect and continue, logging the mismatch at ``INFO`` level (default).
        | ``0``: Fail initialization with ``ncclSystemError`` and a warning on the mismatch.

    * - | ``NCCL_IGNORE_COLLNET_MISMATCH``
        | Same as ``NCCL_IGNORE_NET_MISMATCH`` but for the number of local CollNet
          devices reported by each rank.
      - | ``0``: Fail initialization with ``ncclSystemError`` and a warning on the mismatch (default).
        | ``1``: Detect and continue, logging the mismatch at ``INFO`` level.

    * - | ``NCCL_IB_MERGE_NICS``
        | Enables RCCL to combine several physical IB NICs that are close to the
          same GPU into a single logical network device (NIC Fusion). This allows
          RCCL to aggregate the bandwidth of those NICs. Use
          ``NCCL_NET_MERGE_LEVEL`` and ``NCCL_NET_FORCE_MERGE`` to control which
          NICs are combined.
      - | ``1``: Enabled (default).
        | ``0``: Disabled.
        | On AINIC with the ``IB-CAST`` transport, merging is off unless this
          variable is explicitly set to ``1``.

    * - | ``NCCL_NET_MERGE_LEVEL``
        | Sets the maximum topological distance between two NICs that can be
          merged into a single logical device. NICs farther apart than this level
          are left separate.
      - | ``LOC``: Same device only, which disables merging.
        | ``PORT``: Two ports of the same NIC (default).
        | ``PIX``: Under the same PCIe switch.
        | ``PXB``: Multiple PCIe bridges, without crossing the PCIe host bridge.
        | ``P2C``, ``PXN``: Accepted, with the same effect as ``PXB`` for NIC pairs.
        | ``PHB``: Under the same CPU socket.
        | ``SYS``: Anywhere in the node, including across NUMA nodes.
        | The value is a string, so ``PATH_PORT`` is not valid. An unrecognized
          value falls back to ``LOC`` and disables merging.

    * - | ``NCCL_NET_FORCE_MERGE``
        | Merges the listed groups of NICs regardless of
          ``NCCL_NET_MERGE_LEVEL``. NICs that are not listed are then merged
          automatically.
      - | Semicolon-separated list of groups, each a comma-separated list of
          device names in ``NCCL_IB_HCA`` notation.
        | Default: unset.

    * - | ``NCCL_NETDEVS_POLICY``
        | Controls how many of a GPU's locally reachable NICs are used on the
        | network path for ``send``, ``recv``, and ``all-to-all``. The policy
        | governs per-channel NIC selection (``ncclTopoGetLocalNet``); the
        | per-peer network channel count is still bounded by available NIC
        | bandwidth.
        | Any unset, malformed, or out-of-range value falls back to ``AUTO``.
      - | ``AUTO`` (default): use ``ceil(localNetCount / localGpuCount)`` NICs,
        | dividing the local NICs across the GPUs that share them.
        | ``ALL``: use every locally reachable NIC.
        | ``MAX:N``: use at most ``N`` NICs (clamped to the number reachable);
        | ``N`` must be a positive integer.

    * - | ``RCCL_IB_SPLIT_DATA_THRESHOLD``
        | Minimum message size (in bytes) before the payload is split across
        | multiple NICs/QPs.
        | Smaller messages use one QP for data to reduce latency.
        | This variable can be leveraged when NIC Fusion (``NCCL_NET_MERGE_LEVEL``) and/or data splitting on QPs (``NCCL_IB_SPLIT_DATA_ON_QPS``) is enabled.
      - | Integer value in bytes (default: ``128``)
        | ``N``: Split only when message size >= N bytes

    * - | ``NCCL_NCHANNELS_PER_NET_PEER``
        | Sets the number of channels used per network (remote) peer.
        | This overrides the value of the ``nChannelsPerNetPeer`` field in
        | ``ncclConfig_t``. When neither this variable nor the config field is
        | set, RCCL auto-tunes the per-peer channel count based on the
        | available NIC bandwidth and rank count.
      - | Integer value, ``1`` to ``MAXCHANNELS`` (default: unset/auto-tuned)
        | Values ``<= 0`` are ignored and a warning is logged.
        | Values ``> MAXCHANNELS`` set through ``ncclConfig_t`` are rejected
        | with ``ncclInvalidArgument`` at communicator initialization.

    * - | ``NCCL_P2P_MAX_PEERS``
        | Sets the maximum number of peers a rank communicates with concurrently
        | over P2P. This overrides the value of the ``maxP2pPeers`` field in
        | ``ncclConfig_t``. Where it applies, RCCL divides the P2P channel pool
        | among this many peers instead of among all ranks, so a smaller value
        | gives each peer more channels, affecting ``ncclSend``/``ncclRecv`` and
        | the send/recv-based collectives (all-to-all, scatter, gather). It does
        | not restrict which peers a rank is allowed to communicate with.
        | It is read in two places only: the per-peer channel tiling enabled by
        | ``RCCL_SATURATE_P2P_NCHANNELS`` (on by default for gfx1250 only), and
        | the multi-node per-peer reduction, which requires more than one node
        | and ``NCCL_NCHANNELS_PER_NET_PEER`` / ``nChannelsPerNetPeer`` unset.
        | A single-node job on another architecture with default settings is
        | therefore unaffected.
      - | Integer value, ``1`` to the number of ranks (default: unset, which
        | means the number of ranks in the communicator)
        | Values ``<= 0`` are ignored and a message is logged.
        | Values greater than the communicator size are capped to it.
        | Values ``<= 0`` other than ``NCCL_CONFIG_UNDEF_INT`` set through
        | ``ncclConfig_t`` are rejected with ``ncclInvalidArgument`` at
        | communicator initialization.

    * - | ``NCCL_RINGS``
        | Defines custom ring topology.
      - | Ring topology specification string
        | Overrides automatic topology detection

    * - | ``RCCL_TREES``
        | Defines custom tree topology.
      - | Tree topology specification string
        | Alternative to ring topology

    * - | ``NCCL_RINGS_REMAP``
        | Controls ring remapping for specific topologies.
      - | Remapping specification string
        | Used with Rome 4P2H topology

    * - | ``NCCL_GIN_PLUGIN``
        | Selects external GIN (GPU-Initiated Networking) plugins.
      - | Comma-separated list of paths or short names
        | A short name is resolved against the ``librccl-gin`` prefix, so
          ``example`` loads ``librccl-gin-example.so``
        | A plugin reporting the proxy device type is superseded by the built-in
          GIN proxy. See :ref:`using-rccl-gin-plugin`

    * - | ``NCCL_GIN_ENABLE``
        | Controls whether any GIN backend is registered. RCCL-specific.
      - | ``1``: Register GIN backends (default)
        | ``0``: Register none, so GIN reports as unsupported

    * - | ``NCCL_GIN_TYPE``
        | Requires a specific GIN backend type, skipping all others.
      - | ``-1``: Disables the generic filter, but does not auto-enable
          the in-tree device backends
        | ``2``: Proxy
        | ``3``: GDAKI
        | ``4``: GPI
        | ``5``: EFA GDA
        | ``6``: rocSHMEM GDA (required for that backend to initialize)
        | ``7``: Anvil SDMA (also accepts unset)

    * - | ``NCCL_RMA_PLUGIN``
        | Selects external one-sided RMA plugins, which are also the backend
          the built-in GIN proxy forwards to.
      - | Comma-separated list of paths or short names
        | A short name is resolved against the ``librccl-rma`` prefix, so
          ``example`` loads ``librccl-rma-example.so``
        | See :ref:`using-rccl-rma-plugin`

Development and testing (advanced)
==================================

The development and testing environment variables for RCCL are
collected in the following table. These variables are primarily
intended for debugging and development purposes.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 40,60

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Values**

    * - | ``CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING``
        | Controls CUDA kernel launch blocking behavior.
      - | ``0``: Non-blocking launches
        | ``1`` or non-zero: Blocking launches

    * - | ``NCCL_COMM_ID``
        | Enables multi-process mode in test applications.
      - | Any non-empty value enables multi-process mode
        | Used with test executables for distributed testing

    * - | ``NCCL_DISABLE_MEM_MANAGER``
        | Disables the internal RCCL memory manager. This is an internal
          parameter intended for testing and debugging only. When the memory
          manager is disabled, ``ncclCommSuspend``, ``ncclCommResume``, and
          ``ncclCommMemStats`` return ``ncclInvalidUsage``.
      - | ``0``: Memory manager enabled (default).
        | ``1``: Memory manager disabled.

    * - | ``NCCL_NO_CACHE``
        | Disables caching for selected RCCL environment parameters so their
          values are re-read from the environment on each access. By default,
          RCCL caches parameter values after the first read for performance.
          This variable is intended for testing and debugging when parameters
          need to be changed without restarting the process. The value is
          parsed once on first use, so it must be set before RCCL reads any
          parameters. ``NCCL_NO_CACHE`` itself is always cached and cannot
          be listed.
      - | Unset (default): all parameters are cached after first read.
        | Comma-separated list of parameter names (for example,
          ``NCCL_DEBUG,NCCL_ALGO``): disable caching for those keys only.
        | ``ALL``: disable caching for every parameter except
          ``NCCL_NO_CACHE``.

Multi-communicator ordering
===========================

When an application uses multiple RCCL communicators on the same device,
collective operations may execute in an unpredictable order unless the
application adds explicit synchronization between streams.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 40,60

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Values**

    * - | ``NCCL_LAUNCH_ORDER_IMPLICIT``
        | Serializes RCCL operations across different communicators on the
        | same device according to their host-side launch sequence. This
        | provides deterministic execution order for multi-communicator
        | workloads such as chained collectives where one operation's
        | output feeds into the next.
      - | ``0``: Disabled (default).
        | ``1``: Enabled. Operations execute in host launch order.

Inspector profiling
===================

The RCCL Inspector is a profiler plugin that emits per-communicator,
per-operation performance data (collectives and point-to-point) as JSON or
Prometheus textfile metrics. For a full walkthrough, see
:doc:`../how-to/using-rccl-inspector-plugin`. The Inspector environment
variables are collected in the following table.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 40,60

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Values**

    * - | ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_ENABLE``
        | Enables the Inspector profiler plugin. The plugin must also be
        | loaded through ``NCCL_PROFILER_PLUGIN``.
      - | ``0``: Disabled (default).
        | ``1``: Enabled.

    * - | ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_ENABLE_P2P``
        | Enables tracking of point-to-point (``Send``/``Recv``) operations in
        | addition to collectives. Required for the ``nccl_p2p_*`` Prometheus
        | metrics and the P2P panels of the Grafana dashboard.
      - | ``0``: Disabled.
        | ``1``: Enabled (default).

    * - | ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_PROM_DUMP``
        | Selects the Prometheus node-exporter textfile output format
        | (``nccl_inspector_metrics_<uuid>.prom``) instead of the default JSON.
      - | ``0``: JSON output (default).
        | ``1``: Prometheus textfile output.

    * - | ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_PROM_DUMP_STATS``
        | In Prometheus mode, also emits per-device ring-buffer counters:
        | ``nccl_collectives_total``, ``nccl_collectives_dropped_total``,
        | ``nccl_p2p_total`` and ``nccl_p2p_dropped_total``. They are
        | cumulative, so ``rate(dropped) / rate(total)`` gives the fraction of
        | operations lost. JSON output always carries the same counts in its
        | ``dump_stats`` record.
      - | ``0``: Disabled (default).
        | ``1``: Enabled.

    * - | ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_CLUSTER``
        | Overrides the Prometheus ``cluster`` label. When unset, the Inspector
        | uses ``SLURM_CLUSTER_NAME``. Set this when that name is missing.
      - | String.
        | Default: unset (falls back to ``SLURM_CLUSTER_NAME``, else
        | ``unknown``).

    * - | ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_DUMP_THREAD_ENABLE``
        | Enables the internal dump thread. When disabled, output is only
        | written at communicator teardown, regardless of the configured
        | dump interval.
      - | ``0``: Disabled.
        | ``1``: Enabled (default).

    * - | ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_DUMP_THREAD_INTERVAL_MICROSECONDS``
        | Interval, in microseconds, at which the internal dump thread writes
        | output. Output is always written at communicator teardown.
      - | ``-1``: Dump only at teardown (default).
        | ``0``: Dump continuously.
        | ``N``: Dump every ``N`` microseconds. In Prometheus mode a minimum of
        | ``30000000`` (30 s) is enforced to match node-exporter polling.

    * - | ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_DUMP_DIR``
        | Output directory for Inspector logs/metrics. For Prometheus mode,
        | point this at the node-exporter textfile collector directory.
      - | String path.
        | Default: ``nccl-inspector-<jobid>`` from ``SLURM_JOB_ID``,
        | ``SLURM_JOBID``, ``PBS_JOBID``, or ``LSB_JOBID``, else
        | ``nccl-inspector-unknown-jobid``.

    * - | ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_DUMP_VERBOSE``
        | Includes per-event trace information (sequence numbers and
        | timestamps) in the JSON output.
      - | ``0``: Disabled (default).
        | ``1``: Enabled.

    * - | ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_DUMP_MIN_SIZE_BYTES``
        | Minimum message size (in bytes) tracked by the Inspector.
      - | Integer value in bytes (default: ``8192``).

    * - | ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_REQUIRE_KERNEL_TIMING``
        | Requires GPU-based kernel timing for an event to be recorded. When
        | enabled, events that fall back to CPU-measured timing are discarded.
      - | ``0``: Record events regardless of timing source.
        | ``1``: Record only GPU-timed events (default).

    * - | ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_DUMP_COLL_RING_SIZE``
        | Per-communicator capacity of the ring buffer holding completed
        | collectives waiting to be dumped. When it fills, the oldest entries
        | are overwritten and counted as dropped, with a single warning per
        | process.
      - | Integer number of entries (default: ``1024``).

    * - | ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_DUMP_P2P_RING_SIZE``
        | Per-communicator capacity of the ring buffer holding completed
        | point-to-point operations waiting to be dumped. Overflow is handled
        | as for ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_DUMP_COLL_RING_SIZE``.
      - | Integer number of entries (default: ``1024``).

    * - | ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_COLL_POOL_SIZE``
        | Initial size, and growth stride, of the collective event pool.
      - | Integer number of entries (default: ``256``).

    * - | ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_P2P_POOL_SIZE``
        | Initial size, and growth stride, of the point-to-point event pool.
      - | Integer number of entries (default: ``256``).

    * - | ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_COMM_POOL_SIZE``
        | Initial size, and growth stride, of the communicator event pool.
      - | Integer number of entries (default: ``256``).

    * - | ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_POOL_GROW``
        | Allows the event pools above to grow beyond their initial size. When
        | disabled, events are dropped once a pool is exhausted.
      - | ``0``: Fixed-size pools.
        | ``1``: Pools grow on demand (default).

    * - | ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_OTEL_EXPORT``
        | Exports metrics over OTLP/HTTP instead of writing them to files. The
        | Inspector emits one format only, and this setting takes precedence
        | over ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_PROM_DUMP``.
      - | ``0``: Disabled, so JSON or Prometheus files are written (default).
        | ``1``: Enabled, posting OTLP/JSON to the endpoint below.

    * - | ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_OTEL_VERBOSE``
        | Selects per-collective metric points instead of aggregated ones. The
        | per-collective form additionally reports
        | ``nccl_collective_algobw_gbs`` and the per-device ring-buffer
        | counters described under ``NCCL_INSPECTOR_PROM_DUMP_STATS``.
      - | ``0``: Aggregated (default).
        | ``1``: Per collective.

    * - | ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT``
        | Destination for the OTLP metric export. Also accepts
        | ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT``. ``/v1/metrics`` is appended to
          whichever variable is used when its URL carries no path.
      - | Plaintext ``http://`` URL. ``https://`` is unsupported and disables
          export, so use a local collector when the telemetry is sensitive.
        | Default: ``http://localhost:4318/v1/metrics``

    * - | ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_HEADERS``
        | Extra headers attached to every OTLP request. Also accepts
          ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS``.
      - | Comma-separated ``key=value`` list
        | Sent verbatim over the plaintext connection above, so do not put a
          credential here unless the collector is local.

Profiler plugin
===============

An external profiler plugin loaded through ``NCCL_PROFILER_PLUGIN`` receives the
event types selected by ``NCCL_PROFILE_EVENT_MASK``. RCCL 2.31 raises the plugin
interface to v7, which adds two things a plugin can consume:

* **Per-kernel barrier phases.** Enabling ``ncclProfileKernelPhase`` reports an
  ``initial_sync``, ``compute`` and ``final_sync`` span per kernel channel, each
  timed by the GPU globaltimer. A phase is a child of a kernel-channel event, so
  RCCL enables ``ncclProfileKernelCh`` implicitly whenever the phase bit is set.
  Only symmetric kernels emit phases, which requires buffers registered as
  symmetric windows. Regular collective and point-to-point kernels report
  kernel-channel events without phases.
* **Symmetric-kernel variant metadata.** Collective events carry the symmetric
  kernel variant that ran and a flag marking whether the collective was served
  symmetrically. The in-tree example surfaces these as the ``KernelVariant`` and
  ``IsSymColl`` arguments of its ``COLL`` trace events.

Both are v7-only: the v5 and v6 compatibility layers clear the phase bit, so a
plugin must export ``ncclProfiler_v7`` to receive them.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 40,60

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Values**

    * - | ``NCCL_PROFILER_PLUGIN``
        | Selects an external profiler plugin.
      - | Path or short name
        | A short name is resolved against the ``librccl-profiler`` prefix, so
          ``example`` loads ``librccl-profiler-example.so``

    * - | ``NCCL_PROFILE_EVENT_MASK``
        | Bitmask of the event types the plugin is offered.
      - | ``1``: Group
        | ``2``: Collective
        | ``4``: Point-to-point
        | ``8``: Proxy op
        | ``16``: Proxy step
        | ``32``: Proxy control
        | ``64``: Kernel channel
        | ``128``: Net plugin
        | ``256``: Group API
        | ``512``: Collective API
        | ``1024``: Point-to-point API
        | ``2048``: Kernel launch
        | ``4096``: CE collective
        | ``8192``: CE synchronization
        | ``16384``: CE batch
        | ``32768``: Kernel phase (v7, symmetric kernels only; implies kernel
          channel)
        | ``65536``: RCCL proxy diagnostics
        | Combine by adding, so ``32771`` selects group, collective and kernel
          phase. Default: ``0``

Algorithm dispatch and tuning (gfx1250 / MI450)
================================================

The following variables control per-architecture algorithm and protocol dispatch,
including the DDA fabric tiers, Copy Engine (CE) AllReduce, and the per-architecture
threshold table introduced for gfx1250.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 40,60

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Values**

    * - | ``RCCL_IGNORE_ARCH_TABLE``
        | Controls whether the per-architecture dispatch table
          (``rcclArchThresholds``) is used to set DDA, CE, and symmetric-kernel
          thresholds, or whether pre-table compile-time constants are used instead.
          When the table is active (``0``), each threshold variable below
          (``RCCL_DDA_THRESHOLD``, ``RCCL_DDA_LL_THRESHOLD``, etc.) defaults to
          ``-1`` (unset) and is resolved from the table at runtime; setting any of
          those variables explicitly still overrides the table.
      - | ``0``: Use the per-architecture table for threshold defaults (default).
        | ``1``: Ignore the table; fall back to pre-table compile-time constants.
          This matches the behavior before the arch table was introduced.

    * - | ``RCCL_DDA_THRESHOLD``
        | Upper bound in bytes for the DDA VMM/Simple tier per collective.
          Messages above this size exit DDA and fall through to Ring, CE, or the
          symmetric kernel. When set to ``-1`` (default), the value is resolved
          from the per-architecture table (``ddaVmmMax`` field). Set
          ``RCCL_IGNORE_ARCH_TABLE=0`` for the table to take effect.
      - | ``-1``: Resolved from the per-arch table at runtime (default).
        | ``0``: Disable the DDA VMM tier for all collectives.
        | ``N`` (bytes): Use ``N`` as the VMM tier ceiling for all collectives,
          overriding the table. Pre-table default: ``134217728`` (128 MiB).

    * - | ``RCCL_DDA_LL_THRESHOLD``
        | Upper bound in bytes for the DDA LL (low-latency) tier. Messages at or
          below this size use the LL protocol; larger messages move to LL128 or VMM.
          When ``-1`` (default), resolved from ``ddaLLMax`` in the arch table.
      - | ``-1``: Resolved from the per-arch table at runtime (default).
        | ``0``: Disable the DDA LL tier.
        | ``N`` (bytes): Use ``N`` as the LL tier ceiling, overriding the table.
          Pre-table default: ``65536`` (64 KiB).

    * - | ``RCCL_DDA_LL128``
        | Enables the DDA LL128 protocol tier. When ``-1`` (auto), LL128 is enabled
          only for architectures whose per-arch table has a non-zero ``ddaLL128Max``
          entry (currently gfx1250 only). ``1`` forces the tier on but still reads
          its ceiling from the arch table, so it yields the same effective cap as
          ``-1`` in every current configuration; ``0`` disables the tier on all
          architectures.
      - | ``-1``: Auto-enabled only when the arch table has non-zero LL128 thresholds
          (default).
        | ``0``: Disabled on all architectures.
        | ``1``: Force-enabled; ceiling is still read from the arch table (same cap
          as ``-1`` in every current configuration).
    * - | ``RCCL_DDA_LL128_THRESHOLD``
        | Upper bound in bytes for the DDA LL128 tier. Messages above this size move
          to VMM/Simple or Ring. When ``-1`` (default), resolved from ``ddaLL128Max``
          in the arch table. When set explicitly, it takes precedence over ``RCCL_DDA_LL128=0`` (the env var is read before the flag check).
      - | ``-1``: Resolved from the per-arch table at runtime (default).
        | ``0``: Disable the DDA LL128 tier.
        | ``N`` (bytes): Use ``N`` as the LL128 tier ceiling, overriding the table.
          Pre-table default: ``0`` (LL128 tier was off before the arch table).

    * - | ``RCCL_CE_ALLREDUCE``
        | Enables the Copy Engine (CE) registered-window AllReduce path. When ``-1`` (auto),
          CE AllReduce is on by default for gfx1250 communicators that meet all
          eligibility criteria, and off for all other architectures.
      - | ``-1``: Auto — enabled on gfx1250, disabled elsewhere (default).
        | ``0``: Disabled on all architectures.
        | ``1``: Force-enabled (subject to other eligibility checks such as buffer
          registration and message size).

    * - | ``RCCL_FORCE_CE_ALLREDUCE``
        | Bypasses the ``NCCL_CTA_POLICY=2`` (``CTA_POLICY_ZERO``) requirement for
          CE AllReduce, allowing CE to run without symmetric window registration.
          Does not override the staging buffer size cap (``RCCL_CE_AR_MAX_MSG_BYTES``
          or the arch table ``ceNonRegMax[AR]``); that cap is enforced regardless.
          When ``-1`` (auto), follows the same gfx1250-default logic as
          ``RCCL_CE_ALLREDUCE``.
      - | ``-1``: Auto — same default as ``RCCL_CE_ALLREDUCE`` (default).
        | ``0``: Disabled.
        | ``1``: Force-enabled (CTA_POLICY check bypassed).

    * - | ``RCCL_CE_AR_MAX_MSG_BYTES``
        | Overrides the CE 2-shot AllReduce message size cap. When ``-1`` (default),
          the cap is read from ``ceNonRegMax[AllReduce]`` in the per-arch table. A
          null or unknown-arch table restores the pre-table 256 MiB default. This
          variable sizes the selector only; it does not affect the staging buffer
          allocation (see ``RCCL_CE_AR_STAGING_BYTES``).
      - | ``-1``: Resolved from the per-arch table (default).
        | ``N`` (bytes): Use ``N`` as the 2-shot AllReduce size cap.

    * - | ``RCCL_CE_AR_REG_MAX_MSG_BYTES``
        | Overrides the CE registered-window AllReduce message size cap. When ``-1``
          (default), the cap is read from ``ceRegMax[AllReduce]`` in the per-arch
          table. This is the upper bound for the path where both send and receive
          buffers are in symmetric windows (``-R 2`` mode in rccl-tests).
      - | ``-1``: Resolved from the per-arch table (default).
        | ``N`` (bytes): Use ``N`` as the registered AllReduce size cap.

    * - | ``RCCL_CE_AR_STAGING_BYTES``
        | Overrides the total allocation size of the CE AllReduce staging buffer
          (``ceARTmpBuf``). When ``-1`` (default), the buffer is allocated at the
          compile-time constant ``NCCL_CE_AR_STAGING_BYTES`` (16 MiB). Increasing
          this reduces pipelining overhead for large messages but raises per-rank
          GPU memory usage. This variable sizes the buffer only; the selector cap
          is controlled separately by ``RCCL_CE_AR_MAX_MSG_BYTES``.
      - | ``-1``: Use the compile-time default of 16 MiB (default).
        | ``N`` (bytes): Set the per-slot payload capacity to ``N``; ``ceARTmpBuf`` is ``NCCL_CE_NUM_SLOTS`` (2) times that.
